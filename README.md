# Clawlova — Chat Application with OpenClaw

A full-stack chat application that connects to an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) instance running in Docker. Users send messages and receive streaming AI responses with live tool call visualization.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (v2)
- An **OpenAI API key** (or another LLM provider key supported by OpenClaw)
- **Node.js 22+** and **npm** (for local development only)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone <repo-url> && cd clawlova

# 2. Create .env with your API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# 3. Start the full stack
docker compose up --build

# 4. Open the chat UI
open http://localhost:3000
```

The first startup takes ~60 seconds while OpenClaw initializes its config, the gateway starts, and the cockpit device is automatically paired.

**Data flow for a chat message:**

1. User types a message in the browser
2. `useChat()` (TanStack AI) sends a POST to `/api/chat`
3. The server route calls `createOpenClawSessionStream()` which opens a WebSocket to the gateway
4. The bridge performs device auth (challenge-response with Ed25519 keypair), then sends `chat.send`
5. Gateway streams back `assistant` deltas and `tool` events
6. `translateGatewayEvent()` converts these into TanStack AI `StreamChunk` format
7. Chunks flow back to the browser as Server-Sent Events
8. React renders text with markdown and tool calls as expandable cards

### Docker Compose Services

| Service | Role |
|---------|------|
| `openclaw-init` | One-shot: generates OpenClaw config and bootstrap gateway token |
| `openclaw-gateway` | The AI agent runtime — accepts WebSocket connections, runs tools |
| `cockpit-bootstrap` | One-shot: generates device keypair, pairs with gateway, persists token |
| `cockpit` | The chat web app (this project) — serves UI on port 3000 |
| `openclaw-cli` | Optional: interactive CLI for manual OpenClaw commands |

## Architectural Decisions and Trade-offs

### WebSocket gateway protocol vs HTTP chat completions

OpenClaw exposes two interfaces: an OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`) and a native WebSocket gateway protocol.

**Chose WebSocket** because the HTTP endpoint only streams text deltas, while the WebSocket protocol exposes structured `tool` events with phases (`start`, `result`, `error`), tool names, arguments, and results. This is required for the tool call display bonus feature.

**Trade-off:** The WebSocket protocol is undocumented beyond source code. It requires implementing challenge-response auth, JSON-RPC framing, and a custom event translation layer. The HTTP endpoint would have been a single `fetch()` call. In the future, we can vendor the OpenClaw package and extract the WebSocket schemas directly from the source, eliminating guesswork around the protocol format.

### TanStack Start as the full-stack framework

TanStack Start provides SSR with React 19, file-based routing, React Query integration, and first-party AI streaming support (`@tanstack/ai`). The AI package defines a `StreamChunk` protocol that the frontend's `useChat()` hook consumes natively.

**Trade-off:** TanStack Start is newer than Next.js/Remix and has less community documentation. However, its AI streaming primitives (`toServerSentEventsResponse`, `fetchServerSentEvents`) eliminated the need for custom SSE parsing, and the type-safe router caught routing issues at build time.

### Device auth via bootstrap init container

A dedicated `cockpit-bootstrap` service runs before the cockpit starts. It generates an Ed25519 keypair, connects to the gateway over the shared Docker network (loopback), and persists the device token to a shared volume.

**Trade-off:** Adds a service to the compose stack and ~10 seconds to first startup. But it means users never need to manually approve devices or run CLI commands — just `docker compose up` and it works.

### Session bridge as a translation layer

The core integration is a single file (`openclaw-session-bridge.ts`, ~810 lines) that translates between two APIs: OpenClaw's gateway WebSocket protocol and TanStack AI's `StreamChunk` format. It handles auth, connection lifecycle, and event mapping.

**Trade-off:** Tightly coupled to both APIs — changes in either require updating the bridge. But the coupling is contained in one file with clear boundaries: `buildConnectParams()` owns the gateway side, `translateGatewayEvent()` owns the TanStack side. Either could be swapped without touching the other.

### Single WebSocket connection per chat turn

Each chat message opens a new WebSocket connection, performs auth, sends the message, streams the response, and closes. There is no persistent connection across messages.

**Trade-off:** Slightly higher latency per message (WebSocket handshake + auth ~100ms). A persistent connection would be faster for rapid back-and-forth, but significantly more complex to manage (reconnection, session state, stale connections). For a chat app where users read responses before typing, the overhead is negligible.

## Bonus Features

### Device Authentication

Full implementation of the OpenClaw device auth protocol:
- Ed25519 keypair generation with SHA256-derived device ID
- Challenge-response signing (`v2` payload format)
- Automatic device pairing via Docker bootstrap service
- Token persistence and reuse across restarts

### Tool Call Display

Streaming tool call events rendered as expandable UI cards:
- Tool name and execution status (running, completed, error)
- Input parameters displayed as formatted JSON
- Output results shown on completion
- Status icons and color coding

### Config Generator

A web UI at `/config` to view and update the OpenClaw configuration file (`openclaw.json`) programmatically — no manual JSON editing required.

- **Auth Profiles** — Add/remove provider profiles, set auth mode (`api_key`, `oauth`, `token`). Shows which env var to set for each provider's API key.
- **Model Selection** — Provider dropdown + model dropdown. Models are fetched live from the provider API (OpenAI `/v1/models`, Anthropic `/v1/models`) when a valid API key is available, with hardcoded fallback lists. Switching providers auto-selects the first available model.
- **Tools** — Toggle web search, select search provider (DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing), choose tool profile (coding, general, minimal).
- **Gateway** — Port, bind mode (loopback/LAN), auth token, allowed CORS origins. UI warns when changes require a container restart.
- **Plugins** — Enable/disable plugins, add new ones by name.

The server-side API (`GET /api/config`, `PUT /api/config`) reads and writes the config file directly. The gateway watches the file and hot-reloads most changes automatically — only gateway server settings (port, bind, auth) need a restart. Secrets (gateway token) are masked in API responses and preserved on save.
